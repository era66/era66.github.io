    <h1>[love is more thicker than forget]</h1>
    <h2>by E.E. Cummings</h2>
    <br>
    <P class="one">love is more thicker than forget <br>
        more thinner than recall<br>
        more seldom than a wave is wet<br>
        more frequent than to fail</P> 
    <P class="two">it is most mad and moonly<br>
        and less it shall unbe<br>
        than all the sea which only<br>
        is deeper than the sea</P>
    <p class="three"> love is less always than to win<br>
        less never than alive<br>
        less bigger than the least begin<br>
        less littler than forgive</p>
    <P class="four">it is most sane and sunly<br>
        and more it cannot die<br>
        than all the sky which only<br>
        is higher than the sky</P>
